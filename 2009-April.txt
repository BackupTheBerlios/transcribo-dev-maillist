Subject: [Transcribo-dev] Transcribo's files are now in the public repository
Message-ID: <JNEPIPKLMDDNHIAOHDNBEECBCCAA.fhaxbox66@googlemail.com>

Hi,

I have just pushed the first snapshot of Transcribo. While the renderer
works surprisingly well (just run test/test.py to see a nested enumeration),
the writer for ducutils does not do anything yet. This is simply because I
haven't started working on it.

Any feedback is welcome.

Leo
