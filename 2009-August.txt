Betreff: First public alpha release of Transcribo - a plain text
renderer for rST and other input formats


Hi,

Transcribo-0.5 is out. Visit http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Transcribo/ for
more info. Alongside with the Docutils writer, there is now a module to
process plain text input. The command line tools provide some control on the
output. In particular, the translator (useful for embossing Braille) is
configurable.

The rST module implements a reasonable subset of rST which now includes
section numbers, line blocks, inline literals, lists and enumerations and
topics. Many features, including control of the renderer through rST
directives, page references and TOCs with page numbers are planned.

While I am not aware of any severe bugs, some features would benefit from
refinement. Also, the documentation (planned with Sphinx) is sparse. But the
command line tools should be self-explanatory to anyone, and the renderer's
API is illustrated by the rST and plaintext frontend as well as a
stand-alone test script.

 Have fun!

Leo

This is another bug fix release. test.py works again after changing some
dictionary keys in styles.py. In addition, the scripts are not installed in
Python's script directory.
